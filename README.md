Peridot
=======

The Peridot programing language is an esoteric programming language based on [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and fully compatible with it.
It was designed to extend the functionality of Brainfuck.

Uploaded Live Interpreter (0.1a version) is covering 100% of Peridot (0.1a version) commands. The interpreter is written for Windows and Linux systems.

Peridot language and Peridot Live Interpreter are in alpha stage so far. I am planing to expand Peridot's functionalities, and create its own compilator.

Changelog:
* 0.1a Alpha version, initial release.
  * Full coverage of BrainFuck's 8 instructions (full compatibility)
  * Additional 13 instructions
  * Two loops. Basic BrainFuck's "[...]" if-not-zero-loop and additional "{...}" if-zero-loop
  * Four conditional statements (if equal; if not equal; if greater; if less)

Peridot Live Interpreter - Usage
--------------------------------

**Peridot.exe** and **peridot**(Linux) can be started using no arguments or filename as argument like so:

> Peridot.exe hello_world.p

When no arguments are provided **Peridot.exe** will look for *spoint.p* file to execute.

Peridot Live Interpreter - Linux install process
------------------------------------------------

**cd /usr/crc**
**wget **
