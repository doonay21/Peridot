Peridot
=======

The Peridot programing language is an esoteric programming language based on [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and fully compatible with it.
It was designed to extend the functionality of Brainfuck.

* 0.1a Alpha version, initial release.
  * Full coverage of BrainFuck's 8 instructions (full compability)
  * Additional 13 instructions

Peridot Interpreter - Usage
---------------------------

**Peridot.exe** can be started using filename as argument or using no arguments like so:

> Peridot.exe hello_world.p

When no arguments are provided **Peridot.exe** will look for *spoint.p* file to execute.
